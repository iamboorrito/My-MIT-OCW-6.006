# My-MIT-OCW-6.006
My progress through MIT OCW's 6.006.

This is where I am putting my notes and python code as I go through the lectures on YouTube for MIT's intro algorithms class.

I won't be able to implement all algorithms covered, but I hope to cover the common ones. Some lectures are mostly theory, but my notes will still be put
here for future reference.
